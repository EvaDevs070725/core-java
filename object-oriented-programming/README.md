## 1. ❓ What are the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming?

### 🔍 Concept Check
**List and explain the four principles:**

- **Encapsulation:**
  > ...

- **Abstraction:**
  > ...

- **Inheritance:**
  > ...

- **Polymorphism:**
  > ...

### 💻 Code Practice
Create a class that demonstrates all four OOP principles using:

- private fields and public getters/setters
- inheritance with method overriding
- abstract class or interface
- method overloading

### ❓ Reflection
**Which principle improves code reuse and which improves security?**

## 2. ❓ What is the difference between Object-Oriented Programming language and Object-Based Programming language?

### 🔍 Concept Check
| Feature              | OOP Language (e.g., Java) | Object-Based (e.g., JavaScript, VBScript) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Inheritance          | Supported                 | Not supported                             |
| Polymorphism         | Supported                 | Limited                                   |
| Encapsulation        | Supported                 | Supported                                 |
| Class-based design   | Yes                       | No (Prototype-based)                      |

### 💻 Code Practice
- Create a class in Java with inheritance and another with just object usage (without inheritance).
- Try mimicking JavaScript-like object-based behavior.

### ❓ Reflection
**Can you call JavaScript a true OOP language? Why or why not?**

## 3. ❓ In Java, what is the default value of an object reference defined as an instance variable?

### 🔍 Concept Check
**Your Answer:**

> ...

### 💻 Code Practice
```java
public class DefaultObject {
    String name;

    void printName() {
        System.out.println(name); // should print: null
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new DefaultObject().printName();
    }
}
```
