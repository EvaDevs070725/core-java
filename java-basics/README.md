# Java Basics

## _`JVM`, `JDK`, and `JRE`?_

**JVM (Java Virtual Machine):**
- **Execution Environment**: Provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode.
- **Platform Independence**: Converts bytecode into machine-specific instructions.
- **Memory Management**: Manages memory allocation and garbage collection.
- **Interprets Bytecode**: Interprets Java bytecode or JIT compiles it into native machine code for execution.

**JRE (Java Runtime Environment):**
- **Runtime Environment**: Provides the environment necessary for running Java applications.
- **Includes JVM**: Contains JVM along with core libraries and other components needed for executing Java applications.
- **No Development Tools**: Does not include development tools like compiler and debugger.

**JDK (Java Development Kit):**
- **Development Kit**: Includes JRE along with development tools such as compiler (`javac`), debugger, and other tools (e.g., `javadoc`).
- **For Development**: Used for developing Java applications, including compiling, debugging, and packaging applications.
- **Complete Package**: Includes everything needed for both development and execution of Java applications.
